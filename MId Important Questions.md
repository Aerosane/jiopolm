**Subjective paper( EX:Scenario-Based Question)** 

Amazon uses a unique digital code on every product for inventory tracking. The Stores 

Department wants to perform a quick check on the code entered by the staff. 

Write a C program to help the Store Department with the following tasks: 

1. Read a product code number from the user. 
1. Find the sum of digits of the given number. 
1. Using that sumvalueas a range limit,calculate and  print: 

   i) The sumof even number sup to that limit. ii)The sum of odd numbers up to that limit. 

Input: Enterproductcode:7532 

Processing: 

Sumof digits =7+5 +3+2 =17 

Range=1to17 

Sumof even numbers = 2 +4 +6 +8+10 +12 + 14 +16 =72 Sumof odd numbers =1+3 +5 +7+9 +11 +13+15 +17 =81 

Output: 

Sumofdigits:17 

Sumofevennumbersupto17:72 Sum of odd numbers up to 17: 81
